# üì¶ App Configurations for macOS & iOS

Welcome to the **App Configs** library ‚Äî a collection of pre‚Äëbuilt **Managed App Configurations** for common productivity apps used in Jamf Pro environments. These configurations let administrators define app settings automatically, without manual user setup.

---

## üß≠ Overview
Each subfolder in this directory contains a ready‚Äëto‚Äëuse XML or JSON configuration file designed for Jamf Pro‚Äôs **Application & Custom Settings** payload. These payloads control how supported apps like Outlook, Teams, Zoom, Box, and OneDrive behave once deployed to macOS or iOS devices.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
Jamf Pro supports app‚Äëspecific configuration profiles using **Managed App Config** payloads. These profiles push preferences directly into supported apps via MDM, enforcing settings such as sign‚Äëin restrictions, default storage locations, or UI preferences.

When a device receives the profile, the target app automatically applies those settings ‚Äî giving end users a secure and preconfigured experience with minimal onboarding friction.

## üß∞ How to Deploy an App Config

1. **Download** the configuration file for the desired app from its subfolder.
2. In **Jamf Pro ‚Üí Computers ‚Üí Configuration Profiles ‚Üí New**, create a new profile.
3. Under **Application & Custom Settings**:
   - Choose **Upload** and select the `.xml` or `.plist` file provided here.
   - Or choose **Custom Schema** and paste the included JSON schema, if available.
4. Assign a clear profile name (e.g., *Outlook Managed Settings*).
5. **Scope** to a pilot Smart Group for testing.
6. Deploy and monitor installation results under **Computers ‚Üí History ‚Üí Profiles**.

## üîç Validation Steps
1. On a test device, run an inventory update in Jamf Pro.
2. Verify the configuration profile appears under **System Settings ‚Üí Profiles**.
3. Launch the app and confirm preconfigured settings apply automatically.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Some settings only take effect on first launch ‚Äî test using a fresh app install when validating.

## üßë‚Äçüîß Troubleshooting
| Issue | Possible Cause | Tip |
|--------|-----------------|-----|
| Config doesn‚Äôt apply | Incorrect bundle identifier | Confirm using `defaults read` or AppConfig docs |
| Profile installs but app ignores keys | App version mismatch | Update to a supported version |
| Invalid profile upload | Syntax error | Validate XML/JSON using `plutil` or `jq` |

## üßæ Notes
- Each app folder includes its own `README.md` explaining the keys, values, and deployment behavior in more detail.
- Configurations follow **vendor documentation** whenever possible.
- Always test before deploying at scale.

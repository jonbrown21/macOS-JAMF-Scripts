# ‚òÅÔ∏è OneDrive for macOS ‚Äî Managed App Configuration

This configuration file allows Jamf Pro administrators to manage **Microsoft OneDrive for macOS** settings via MDM.  
It enforces enterprise sync rules, automates Known Folder Move (KFM), and disables personal account syncing to maintain compliance across managed Macs.

---

## üß≠ Overview
OneDrive supports the **Managed Preferences (MCX/MDM)** model for macOS, allowing administrators to preconfigure settings that improve security and streamline onboarding.  
By deploying this configuration profile, users automatically connect their corporate account and have Desktop and Documents folders silently redirected to OneDrive using **KFM (Known Folder Move)**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment Steps

1. **Download** the OneDrive configuration file (`OneDrive_macOS.plist`).
2. In **Jamf Pro ‚Üí Computers ‚Üí Configuration Profiles ‚Üí New**, create a new profile.
3. Under **Application & Custom Settings**:
   - Select **Upload** and choose the provided PLIST file.
   - Enter the App Bundle ID:
     ```
     com.microsoft.OneDrive
     ```
4. Assign the profile to your desired **Smart Group** or device scope.
5. Save and deploy the configuration profile.

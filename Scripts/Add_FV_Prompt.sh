#
# Description:
# This script is used to grant FileVault access to a specified user account by adding them to the FileVault 2 pre-boot authorization list using `fdesetup add`.
#
# What it does:
# 1. Prompts the logged-in user via AppleScript dialogs to input the credentials of an existing FileVault-enabled admin user.
# 2. Uses the provided credentials along with a known username/password pair (passed as $4 and $5) to authorize and add that user to FileVault.
# 3. Executes the `fdesetup add` command via `expect` to handle interactive password prompts in an automated fashion.
#
# ⚠️ Note:
# - This script assumes the Mac is already encrypted with FileVault and that the admin user being used for authorization already has FileVault access.
# - It requires GUI interaction (via dialogs) and is not suited for silent or background execution.
# - Ensure `expect` is available on the system or installed prior to use.

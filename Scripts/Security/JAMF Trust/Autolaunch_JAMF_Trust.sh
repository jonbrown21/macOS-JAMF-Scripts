# Description:
# This script ensures that the **Jamf Trust VPN client** launches automatically at login
# for the currently logged-in user by adding it to their macOS login items.
#
# What it does:
# 1. Detects the currently logged-in user and their UID.
# 2. Uses `launchctl asuser` with `osascript` to programmatically add **Jamf Trust.app**
#    to that user's login items (i.e., System Preferences â†’ Users & Groups â†’ Login Items).
# 3. This ensures Jamf Trust automatically starts at login, helping to maintain consistent VPN connectivity.
#
# ðŸ’¡ Why this is useful:
# - Without this, users can easily quit or forget to open the Jamf Trust app, leading to inconsistent VPN protection.
# - This is especially critical in managed environments where remote access and security posture depend on Jamf Trust being active.
#

# Version: 0.3
#
# Description:
# This script uses **Jamf Helper** to display a popup message to users when the **Jamf Trust VPN**
# is not running or has disconnected. It prompts the user to reconnect the VPN via a custom URL scheme.
#
# What it does:
# 1. Detects the current logged-in user.
# 2. Displays a branded Jamf Helper dialog warning the user that Jamf Trust VPN is disconnected.
# 3. Offers the user two options: "Ok" or "Connect VPN". Both trigger the Jamf Trust URL scheme to re-enable VPN access.
# 4. Optionally removes Jamf Protect local extension attributes and workflows used for triggering the notification.
# 5. Sends a recon (`jamf recon`) to update inventory and clear extension attribute flags in Jamf Pro.
#
# âœ… Ideal for:
# - Enforcement of always-on VPN posture.
# - Closing the loop on Jamf Protect alerts tied to Trust VPN disconnects.
#
# For full details on configuring detection, response, and ongoing VPN connectivity enforcement using Jamf Pro and Trust, see:

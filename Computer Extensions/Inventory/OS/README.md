## üìÑ Included EAs

### `enrollment_type.sh`
Reports the **MDM enrollment type** of the Mac (e.g., *Device Enrollment Program (DEP)*, *User Approved MDM*, or *MDM Profile Removed*).  
Useful for confirming whether the Mac was enrolled automatically via Apple Business Manager or manually by a user.

**How it works:**
- Runs `profiles status -type enrollment` and reads the first line of output.
- Returns the enrollment type wrapped in a Jamf `<result>` block.

**Example Output:**
```xml
<result>Device Enrollment Program (DEP)</result>
```

**Use Cases:**
- Detect manually enrolled systems that need re-enrollment.
- Verify proper MDM supervision and ABM compliance.

---

### `last_restart.sh`
Reports the **last system reboot date and time** by reading from the `who -b` command.

**How it works:**
- Executes `who -b` to extract the last boot timestamp.
- Outputs the formatted date and time inside the Jamf EA result block.

**Example Output:**
```xml
<result>2025-10-08 09:17</result>
```

**Use Cases:**
- Track uptime and restart frequency.
- Identify Macs overdue for maintenance reboots.

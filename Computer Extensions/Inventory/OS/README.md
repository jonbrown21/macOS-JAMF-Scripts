# üé• Zoom ‚Äî Managed App Configuration (macOS & iOS)

This configuration allows Jamf Pro administrators to manage **Zoom** for both macOS and iOS using Managed App Configurations.  
It enforces secure authentication through Single Sign-On (SSO), disables personal sign-ins (Google/Facebook), and ensures a consistent enterprise Zoom experience across devices.

---

## üß≠ Overview
Zoom supports MDM-delivered configuration profiles that let IT administrators control sign-in methods, meeting defaults, and other preferences.  
Using these PLIST configurations, admins can force corporate SSO authentication and disable consumer login options on both macOS and iOS clients.

| Profile not installing | Scope misconfiguration | Confirm device assignment and re-push profile |
| iOS app ignoring config | Outdated version | Update Zoom to latest release supporting Managed App Config |

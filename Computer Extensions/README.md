# üß© Computer Extensions ‚Äî Jamf Pro Extension Attributes Library

This directory contains a curated collection of **Jamf Pro Extension Attributes (EAs)** for macOS.  
Each EA gathers a specific system fact, configuration state, or compliance signal that can be displayed in Jamf inventory and used for **Smart Groups**, **compliance policies**, or **reporting**.

---

## üß≠ What Are Extension Attributes?

Extension Attributes extend Jamf Pro‚Äôs device inventory with custom data.  
They run as **scripts** during inventory updates and output a single line of text or number in XML format, such as:

```xml
<result>Enabled</result>
```

Each EA here is:
- Written in **zsh** or **bash**
- Designed to run in **under 2 seconds**
- Outputs a **single, clean result**
- Tested on macOS 12‚Äì15

- Ensure the script exits with `0` to record the result.
- Use consistent data typing for Smart Group accuracy.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Best Practices

- Keep runtime **short and deterministic**.
